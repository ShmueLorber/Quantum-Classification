# Quantum-Classification

The bellow ExampleCode.mlx is intended to create a Quantum Supervised Classification (QSC) network, while n is the overall number of nodes, k is the number of input nodes (and the size of the input states) and q is the number of output nodes (= the number of classes to classify to). Determining these 3 parameters, along with the input states (psi) and the PSO parameters, will output a well-trained QSC that can distinguish between different classes. 2 more codes you can use and manage are parallelCF.m and NeuralNetwork.m . parallelCF.m is the cost function, and you should tune it as you need and as described inside the script. NeuralNetwork.m is the basic code of the QSC network, working based on the Lindblad equation. you can use it to test the trained network or to see how it works. For any other questions please contact the corresponding author.
Enjoy.
